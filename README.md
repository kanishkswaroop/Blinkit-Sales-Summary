Recently created an interactive Power BI Dashboard by working on a real-time end-to-end project. Worked on data cleaning, KPI creation using DAX, and designing visuals with slicers for better insights.

📌 Key Highlights of this Project:
Data Import & Cleaning using Power Query
Data Transformation & Modeling
Created key KPIs like Total Sales, Avg Sales, Total Items, Ratings, etc.
Built interactive visualizations (bar chart, line chart, donut chart, funnel, etc.)
Added slicers & filters for dynamic user interaction
Improved dashboard layout, formatting, and storytelling

📊 Tools Used: 
Microsoft Power BI (Dashboard Development & Reporting)
Power Query (Data Cleaning, Transformation, ETL)
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) (Calculated Measures & KPIs like Total Sales, Avg Sales, Total Items, Ratings)
Data Modeling (Star Schema, Relationships, Fact & Dimension Tables)
Interactive Visualizations (Cards, Bar Charts, Line Charts, Matrix, KPI visuals)
Slicers & Filters (Dynamic user-driven insights)
Excel/CSV Dataset (Data Source for analysis)
